# Figures Folder

This folder contains figures generated from the analysis of a molecular dynamics production trajectory. Each plot is saved as a PNG file.

## Contents

1. **Art-Est_AMBER_end_to_end_distance_vs_time.png**
   - This figure shows the end-to-end distance of the system over time.

2. **Radius_of_Gyration.png**
   - This figure displays the radius of gyration vs. time for the system.

3. **Ions_in_water_CHARMM36M_MSD_vs_Time.png**
   - This figure plots the Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) vs. time for Water Oxygens, Sodium, and Oxygen atoms on the same graph to compare diffusion behaviors.

Each figure is labeled for clarity and corresponds to specific parts of the trajectory analysis.
